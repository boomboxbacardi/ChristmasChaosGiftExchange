# AI Agent Instructions (Components)

- Scope: individual UI components; overrides higher-level instructions if needed.
- Props: keep interfaces small and explicit; validate required props.
- Reusability: avoid coupling to app globals; extract shared pieces where reuse is clear.
- Effects: minimize side effects; keep components mostly presentational when possible.
- Performance: avoid unnecessary renders; memoize only when profiling shows benefit.
- Accessibility: ensure keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and focus management are intact.
