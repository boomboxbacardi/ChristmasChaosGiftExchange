# AI Agent Instructions (Frontend)

- Scope: applies to frontend code; overrides global where conflicts.
- Tech: React + TypeScript; favor functional components and hooks.
- State: keep state minimal and lifted only when necessary; prefer derived data.
- UX: keep UI text concise; ensure accessibility basics (labels, focus, contrasts).
- API usage: handle loading/error states; never block UI on long calls without feedback.
- Styling: respect existing conventions and component patterns.
- Make refactor changes as you go to improve and adhere to atomic design.
